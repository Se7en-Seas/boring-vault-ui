description: Functions to fetch user-specific vault data, such as shares and unlock times, requiring a connected wallet address.
---

## Introduction

These are functions that requires a user to be connected to the dapp with their address exposed via useAddress from wagmi and provide user specific information.

## fetchUserShares

This function provides the decimal adjusted (human readable) numerical value of vault shares that a user owns in their account.

### Inputs

- **userAddress**: the address of the user in the vault you'd like to get the shares for


### Outputs

- A promise that returns the decimal adjusted (human readable) total numerical value of all shares of a vault a user owns

### Example
```tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { useBoringVaultV1 } from 'boring-vault-ui';

const [userShares, setUserShares] = useState<number | null>(null);
const { isBoringV1ContextReady, fetchUserShares } = useBoringVaultV1();


useEffect(() => {
  if (!isBoringV1ContextReady) {
    console.warn("Boring Vault Context is not ready");
    return;
  }

  fetchUserShares('0x...').then(setUserShares);
}, [isBoringV1ContextReady]);

if (userShares) {
  console.log("The user's shares: ", userShares);
}
```

## fetchUserUnlockTime

This function provides the unlock time for when a user may transfer or withdraw their shares.

### Inputs

- **userAddress**: the address of the user in the vault you'd like to get the unlock time for

### Outputs

- A promise that returns the Unix Seconds timestamp for when a user may transfer or withdraw their shares from the vault

### Example
```tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { useBoringVaultV1 } from 'boring-vault-ui';

const [userUnlockTime, setUserUnlockTime] = useState<number | null>(null);
const { isBoringV1ContextReady, fetchUserUnlockTime } = useBoringVaultV1();


useEffect(() => {
  if (!isBoringV1ContextReady) {
    console.warn("Boring Vault Context is not ready");
    return;
  }

  fetchUserUnlockTime('0x...').then(setUserUnlockTime);
}, [isBoringV1ContextReady]);

if (userUnlockTime) {
  console.log("The user's unlock time: ", userUnlockTime);
}
```
